          <p>I've been working in the service industry since I turned 21 and could serve and make alcoholic drinks. As much fun as it is, I'm looking for a career change.</p>
          <p> Thats why I'm here! I have always enjoyed working around computers and used to want to be a software engineer when I was younger. It never really happened until I decided to actually do something about it this last year, when I was unable to work because resturants were closed.</p><p> I'm very excited to learn everything I can to become a great software engineer!</p>
